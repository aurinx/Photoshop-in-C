Description: This program takes in various files in a PPM format and can manipulate them in various ways, including cropping, inverting, swapping, and MORE!

Only half of the program is done at this point. The last 5 functionalities will be implemented later.

Source Files:
a6.c: Main file, runs program
menuUtil.c: Contains the menu, drives the program
ppmIO.c: In charge of reading and writing the PPM files
imageManip.c: Maniuplates the files to crop, invert, etc

Note: The crop function does not work properly. It DOES crop the image to the proper size, however the pixels are not the same and there are some striations within the image.

      The program cannot handle comments after row and columns in the PPM file.
